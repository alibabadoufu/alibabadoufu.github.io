I am a first-year PhD student at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore working on the vision and language in the joint NTU-UBC Research Centre of Excellence in Active Living for the Elderly ([LILY](http://www.ntulily.org/)) under the supervision of [Prof. Cai JianFei](http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/asjfcai/) and [Asst Prof Joty Shafiq Rayhan](https://raihanjoty.github.io/). My research focus is in image and video understanding, natural language processing with tree-based structure and multi-modal deep learning model.

I am currently under the Alibaba Talent Programme where I received full scholarship to pursue my PhD. I am also a PhD Candidate at Alibaba Cloud.
