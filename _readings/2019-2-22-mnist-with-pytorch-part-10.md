I am doing a revision on how to build neural network with PyTorch. To do so I am taking Udacity's online lesson on [Intro to Deep Learning with PyTorch](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-pytorch--ud188). This course introduces many important models such as CNN and RNN using PyTorch. In the subsequent posts, I will try to summarize important points that I have learnt in the course.
